# TriveraGameGUI

use PyQt5 to create the graphic interface of "Who Wants to be a Programmer???"; a computer science trivia game

This is PART 1 of the complete project, where we focus on creating the GUI.
In PART 2, we will load a database of trivia questions and connect all its functionality to our interface.

We'll design the first two frames of this game and learn how to switch from one to the other effortlessly.
also all the important widgets (text, image, button) , we'll go over styling and layout commands, as well as adding interactivity to clickable elements (this is probably my favourite part of PyQt5 - it allows you to create hover events and utilize your pro CSS skills to their full extent!).
